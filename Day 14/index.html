    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const newPlayers = new Array(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const newPlayers2 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    newPlayers.pop();
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    console.log(players);
    console.log(newPlayers)
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      friend: {
        name: 'Alberto'
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // We can perform a shallow copy. It calls this way because if we have and object inside, this object will remain connected to it's reference.
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    const person3 = {...person};

    person.name = 'Wes';
    person2.name = 'Remi';
    person3.age = 100;

    person3.friend.name = 'Nothing';
    person2.friend['age'] = 90;

    // If we want a deep object copy we have to switch it to a non reference type of data, and then, switch it to object.
    const person4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    person4.friend.name = 'Mico';
    person4.friend['age'] = 20;
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    console.log(person);
    console.log(person2);
    console.log(person3);
    console.log(person4);
